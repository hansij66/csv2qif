# Priority and duplicate transactions:
# If you have a transfer from account1 to account2 and
# both accounts are a GnuCash account, and you download
# statements for both accounts, you will end up with same
# transaction twice in GnuCash:
#   from account1 to account2 amount is X euros
#   from account2 to account 1 amount is -X euros
# Based on order in this file (= priority), it is decided
# which transaction will be ignored.
# If the accountFrom has a lower priority than accountTo,
# transaction will be ignored, as the accountTo download will
# add this transaction.
# Chose priority eg based on better quality Memo information
# or quality of payee information
